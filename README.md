# HKUApp

This is one of the assignments of Course Comp7506 at The University of Hong Kong. We aim at building an iOS app showing the homepage @ [Master of Computer Science at Dept. of CS](https://www.msc-cs.hku.hk/ "我是标题").


The language in this project is Swift 4, and We use initial components of iOS, including CollectionView, TableView, ScrollView, etc. Also we send messages via Sague from UIViewControllers to UIViewControllers. We introduced a third-party component called SideMenu, from PC Mex channel, which is easy to handle and makes the layout reasonable.
