# HKUApp

 We use initial components of iOS, including CollectionView, TableView, ScrollView, etc. Also we send messages via Sague from UIViewControllers to UIViewControllers. We introduced a third-party component called SideMenu, from PC Mex channel, which is easy to handle and makes the layout reasonable.

 Yaodong takes responsbility of side-menu part, scroll view part of the codes, while Jiaquan Mai takes responsbility of collection view as well as details of the teachers' information.
